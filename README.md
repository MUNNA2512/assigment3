# Python Functions & Modules Assignment

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating functions and module usage as per Assignment 3 requirements.

## Task 1: Factorial Calculation

### Description
This script implements a factorial calculation function that takes a number as input and returns its factorial. The implementation uses an iterative approach with a loop.

### Implementation Details
- Function Name: `factorial`
- Parameters: Takes a single integer parameter `n`
- Returns: The factorial of the input number
- Algorithm: Uses an iterative loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n
- Special Cases: Returns 1 for input values 0 and 1

### Usage
```python
python task1.py
```

### Example Output
```
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using Math Module

### Description
This script demonstrates the use of Python's built-in math module to perform various mathematical operations on user input.

### Implemented Operations
1. Square Root Calculation
2. Natural Logarithm (log base e)
3. Sine Calculation (in radians)

### Implementation Details
- Uses Python's math module for all calculations
- Includes error handling for invalid inputs
- Provides formatted output with 4 decimal places
- Handles both positive and negative numbers appropriately

### Usage
```python
python task2.py
```

### Example Input/Output
```
Enter a number: 25

Results for number: 25.0
Square root: 5.0000
Natural logarithm: 3.2189
Sine: -0.1324
```

## Technical Details

### Programming Language
- Python 3.x

### Required Modules
- math (built-in Python module)

### Error Handling
- Both scripts include proper error handling
- Input validation for Task 2
- Exception handling for mathematical operations

## Running the Programs
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the desired script using python command

## Code Structure
- Both scripts are self-contained
- Clear function definitions
- Proper documentation within code
- User-friendly output formatting

## Note
The programs are designed to be educational tools demonstrating basic Python function implementation and module usage. They serve as practical examples of mathematical operations in Python programming.
